Introduce yourself.{textboxEnd}

{name:trucy}
...

{name:maya}
(She just inched a little bit behind Nick.)
It's no problem! I'll go first.
Hi,{wait:short} Trucy! It's nice to meet you. My name is Maya!
Erm... I like your clothes! That's a really cool cape. Where'd you get it?

{name:trucy}
...

{name:maya}
(She's just staring at me... it's a little menacing,{wait:short} honestly.)
Uh... how do you like living with your dad?
(She moved a little more behind Nick. Talk about being shy!)


{name:maya}
She doesn't seem to be too excited to meet me.

{name:phoenix}
It's no problem. Knowing you,{wait:short} you'll find a way to open her up.
Seriously,{wait:short} though. It's really good to see you,{wait:short} Maya.

{name:maya}
It's good to see you too. I heard about your badge. What they're saying on TV... it's not true,{wait:short} right?
I mean,{wait:short} forged evidence? No way! Not the Nick I know!
What happened?

{name:phoenix}
It's a long story. To start off,{wait:short} no. I didn't forge anything.
I don't know who made it. I don't even know why the page existed.

{name:maya}
Hm...
You don't think you were set up,{wait:short} do you? That's the only thing I can think of!

{name:phoenix}
I don't know what to think. Yet.
I've had half a month to think about this. I've got theories,{wait:short} but nothing concrete.
...You know,{wait:short} I have a question.

{name:maya}
Huh?

{name:phoenix}
Well,{wait:short} it's bugged me for years. Is spirit channeling technically magic?

{name:maya}
I... guess so? It's supernatural. That technically makes me a magician.

{name:phoenix}
Hear that,{wait:short} Trucy? Aunt Maya's a magician,{wait:short} too!

{name:trucy}
...

{name:trucy}
Are you really?!

{name:maya}
Something like that,{wait:short} yeah! It's a bit more complicated than sleight of hand,{wait:short} though...
(Hah! That got her to smile!)


{name:trucy}
Sleight of hand. Well,{wait:short} I never!
I'll have you know that magic is way more than that!
Now... watch and be amazed by the great Trucy Wright!


{name:maya}
Ooh! Amaze me with what?


{name:trucy}
Well,{wait:short} for my first trick...


{name:maya
}Eeeeeeeeek! (W-What is THAT?!)
(How was she even hiding it?!)

{name:trucy}
Introducing the Incredible Mr. Hat! Say hi,{wait:short} Mr. Hat!

{name:mrhat}
Hi,{wait:short} Mr. Hat!

{name:maya}
I-It talks?! I mean... what a lovely voice you've got,{wait:short} Mr. Hat!

{name:mrhat}
Yours isn't too bad either,{wait:short} dahling!

{name:maya}
Hee-hee! Cool!
What can he do? Sing? Dance?

{name:mrhat}
Dancing,{wait:short} no. Singing,{wait:short} maybe... but I can definitely do this!

{name:maya}
Huh? Ah! My necklace!
...Now it's BIRDS?! How?! How do you do that?!


{name:trucy}
Well,{wait:short} a magician never reveals her secrets. Right,{wait:short} Mr. Hat?

{name:mrhat}
Yessir,{wait:short} Daddy-o!

{name:maya}
(...Can I at least have my necklace back?)

{name:trucy}
Here you are.

{name:trucy}
What kind of magic do you do,{wait:short} Aunt Maya?

{name:maya}
Oh! It's,{wait:short} uh,{wait:short} complicated. (How do I even begin to explain spirit channeling to an 8 year old...?)
(Oh,{wait:short} that's an idea.)
Hey,{wait:short} Trucy! Do you know what the Steel Samurai is?

{name:trucy}
The old cartoon?

{name:maya}
Old? (Is this what it feels like? I'm so sorry,{wait:short} Nick.)
Uh,{wait:short} yeah. You know in that one episode,{wait:short} the Ghostly Guardian shows up and he can summon the ghosts of people?

{name:trucy}
Nope!

{name:maya}
...Never mind.
(I'm gonna culture this kid someday. Mark my words!)
I'll show you my magic another time.

{name:trucy}
Yay! I can't wait!

{name:phoenix}
Trucy,{wait:short} could you give me and Aunt Maya some privacy?

{name:trucy}
Aww. OK.

(fade away)


There's something special about her. I've only known her for a month,{wait:short} but it feels like it's been years.

{name:maya}
I can tell! You're really good with kids,{wait:short} Nick.


{name:phoenix}
Maya...

{name:maya}
What is it?

{name:phoenix}
If there's something deeper here...
If I ever tell you that I think I might be in danger... Promise me that you'll keep Trucy safe.
Please,{wait:short} just keep an eye on her.

{name:maya}
(Now I get it. The look in those eyes... I've seen that look before.)
(Right after Sis... the Edgeworth case... Engarde and Mom,{wait:short} too...)
(He's tired.)
!
This doesn't mean...
(Four years ago...)

{name:phoenix}
I hope not. I don't think so,{wait:short} but I'd rather be prepared.
If people feel cornered,{wait:short} they'll strike back. I might have to risk that. 
I know I'm just being paranoid,{wait:short} but I feel like I have to be.
Even if this is just a mistake or something. Heck,{wait:short} it might just be someone really petty.
It's not a high chance it comes to this,{wait:short} but if it does...

...Well,{wait:short} I'd rather be prepared than unprepared.

{name:maya}
Don't worry,{wait:short} Nick. I promise.
(I can't fail you again. I won't.)

{name:phoenix}
Thank you.

{name:maya}
Who else have you talked to?

{name:phoenix}
Just you,{wait:short} Larry,{wait:short} and Edgeworth.

{name:maya}
Hm. I know what'll cheer you up! You need to talk more.
Be more gregarious,{wait:short} Nick!

{name:phoenix}
I'm plenty gregarious.

{name:maya}
Pfft,{wait:short} as if! I think we need somebody to... whip you into shape.


You mean like a speech therapist?

{name:maya}
No. That's just... foolish.


{name:phoenix}
Maya.

{name:maya}Don't worry about it! I'm sure Franziska can take a break for a day.

{name:phoenix}
You know what? Sure.

{name:maya}
Wait,{wait:short} really?

{name:phoenix}
But only if she gets to meet Trucy.

{name:maya}
Deal! (I've GOTTA see this!)


{name:trucy}
If who gets to meet me?


That's a surprise. You'll see later.


{name:trucy}
OK!

{screenFade:black}

(It was good to see Nick smiling and laughing again. He was obviously taking it hard,{wait:normal} but with Trucy...)
(...Well, I should've known it was all gonna turn out alright.)
(And me? I'm gonna be the best aunt ever! Speaking of which,{wait:short} I've already missed a few birthdays...)
(Hm. What would Trucy want from abroad...?)
