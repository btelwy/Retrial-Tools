Judge:
Mr. Justice, you have performed admirably for a novice attorney.
I respect your partner, Phoenix Wright's determination as well.
Unfortunately... you have not managed to prove your case.
If the trial should end here, I'm unsure how the verdict would be rendered.

Apollo:
(After everything, even with the MASON System, the jurists are still undecided!?)
(Justice is at stake, Justice! Think of something!)

Kristoph:
Precisely... without direct proof, you only embarrass yourself.
Isn't that right, little brother?

Klavier:
Well, it...

Kristoph:
If the court should allow it, I would appreciate a final word with my younger brother.

Judge:
Very well.

Kristoph:
Now then, Klavier: some parting advice from the one who raised you.
This has been an enlightening escapade... if not a bit too melodramatic for my taste.
I had my suspicions, of course...
But I never realized quite how lacking you are.
Rather like the "evidence" you so impulsively tried to thrust at my face.

Klavier:
It is my job to explore every avenue of--

Kristoph:
Your counterproductive habit of holding back?
"All novices require nurturing," I thought.
Fumbling every case you've picked up in your career?
"He's distraught from the loss of his elder brother," I was sure.
But sadly, every opportunity I have provided, you have wasted.

Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin!

Kristoph:
Pardon me, Justice. May I not use my allotted time to speak with my own brother?

Apollo:
(Oh, sure. The murderer is right there, but I'm the bad guy. I get how it is.)

Kristoph:
My own brother... you, Klavier, who are a failure of the man I raised you to be.
I gave you everything. Everything.
We both know you couldn't have dreamed of getting this far without me.
So I suggest you take this victory I'm handing you and do some reflection, yes?

Klavier:
..."Everything" has acquired a new definition, has it?

Kristoph:
This pains me, Klavier.
Picking apart my words in a pathetic attempt to flee the truth...
You truly are the same little boy who broke Father's bonsai.
The same impulsive little boy... who robbed Mother and Father of their lives.

Klavier:
...!

Apollo:
(W-What?)

Kristoph:
Ah, finally. Understanding dawns on your face.
I am glad my message got through before dusk fell on your career.
Tomorrow is a new day, dear brother. Do not waste it as well.

Klavier:
...

Trucy:
Prosecutor Gavin! Don't listen to him!

Kristoph:
(scowling) ...
Your Honor, I am finished. It's high time that I return to my abode.

Judge:
Indeed, it is. Bailiff!

Apollo:
(No! Not now!)
Your Honor!
As the defense has shown, Kristoph Gavin is connected to Mr. Misham's death.
Therefore, Mr. Gavin must not be allowed to leave yet!

Judge:
The defense has shown no such connection.
The defense has shown... a possibility of a connection.
What do you think about the matter, Prosecutor Gavin?

Klavier:
...

Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin! Are you alright?

Klavier:
...

Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin! Snap out of it!

Klavier:
...

Trucy:
Mr. Gavin finally got to him, Apollo!
If he doesn't come back to his senses, we're toast!

Apollo:
I can see that! But it's like he can't hear us...

Judge:
In the absence of a supporting opinion from Prosecutor Gavin...
And given that this questioning has proved unfruitful...
I hereby send the witness back to Central Prison.

Apollo:
No! Your Honor!

Judge:
The cross-examination has ended, Mr. Justice. This is a fact.

Kristoph:
You've come quite a long way, Justice.
If you stop associating with the wrong people, your career will flourish.
Well then... my royal escort is here. I imagine I'll see you... never.
(fades away)

Objection!
(POV changes until it reaches Trucy)

Trucy:
The defense would like to follow a new line of inquiry, Your Honor!

(Kristoph fades back in, scowling)

Apollo:
Trucy!

Trucy:
Well, Apollo? Time for your new line of inquiry.

Apollo:
What are you talking about? I don't have a new line of inquiry!

Trucy:
Exactly. This is the part of the drama where you come up with one and save the day!

Apollo:
This is real life, Trucy! And you just told the judge I have an idea I don't!

Trucy:
Listen, Apollo. You're a pretty cool lawyer, just like Daddy, if I'm being honest.

Apollo:
(You hear that? She finally said I'm cool!)
(...I think a 15 year-old just massaged my ego.)

Trucy:
I believe in you. And now, all that's left is for you to believe in yourself.

Apollo:
(...I think a 15 year-old just called out my self-esteem issues.)

Trucy:
Wipe that "my self-esteem issues just got called out" look off your face.
The jurists won't trust a lawyer looking like that. So turn that frown upside-down!

Apollo:
(Urk!)

Judge:
...Ahem. Am I to understand the defense has a proposal, or not?

Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor.
The defense would like to propose a new line of inquiry.

Kristoph:
The cross-examination has concluded, Your Honor.
I answered everything that I was asked, as was my responsibility on the stand.

Judge:
Indeed. Mr. Justice, if you would like to pose a question, I would as well:
To whom is your question directed?

Apollo:
(Who am I asking a question to?)
(If I want to persuade the jurists, Kristoph is the only possibility, right?)
(Klavier is frozen, Vera is unconscious, and Mr. Wright is occupied.)
(But the cross-examination is over! What do I do!?)

Trucy:
For a lawyer, the worst of times are when you have to force your biggest smiles.
...That's what Daddy says.

Apollo:
(Mr. Wright...? That's it!)
(There's a trick Mr. Wright used twice, back when he was a lawyer.)
(It's more backhanded than I'd like, but I've got nothing else.)
(When a cross-examination is over, the defense can request a new one...)
(...If the witness makes further statements on the stand.)
...Trucy, I've got it.
We need to make the Coolest Defense in the West lose his cool.

Trucy:
Crack his composure, you mean?

Apollo:
Yeah. We need to get him talking.

Trucy:
So, what? We insult his nail polish?

Apollo:
"Every man has an igniter inside him."
Do you remember Mr. Wright saying that?
Set it off, and I'd bet we'd have a good chance.
(So the question is, what is Mr. Gavin's "igniter"?)
(We've already presented all our evidence, and that didn't break him.)

Judge:
Mr. Justice. Your time is up.
I will repeat the question, and this time I expect an answer:
Who would you like to ask a question to?

Apollo:
(Maybe instead of evidence, we need a person who could get him going.)
(A person, here in this courtroom, who could exploit his weaknesses:)
(His arrogance, his desire to be in control...)
(His hatred of a few very specific people.)
Your Honor, the defense is prepared to answer the question.
I'd like to ask a question...
(Who should I ask a question to?
Which person could set Kristoph off?)

(profile select)

Apollo:
I'd like to ask a question... to Ms. Wright.

Trucy:
!
(Looks like she's caught on.)

Kristoph:
I expected the defense would have an idea,
but not that it would be filing for intellectual bankruptcy.

Judge:
The defense questioning their co-counsel...
This is highly irregular. But we've started, so we may as well finish.
Very well. Go ahead, Mr. Justice.

(Kristoph, looking arrogant, fades out)

Apollo:
(It's go time! Before he walks away!)
Ms. Wright.
If you would, please tell the court about your relation to Mr. Gavin.

Trucy:
I've known Mr. Gavin for seven years.
Right about the time Daddy became my Daddy, now that I think about it.
He's such an amazing person: intelligent, talented, cool under pressure...
The whole nine yards, really.
Oh, I'm sorry! I mean Daddy is like that, not Mr. Gavin.
Um... which Daddy am I talking about? Tee hee! I guess both!
Phoenix and Zak are the most impressive people I've ever met.
They worked their way to the top.

(Kristoph reappears, scowling)

Apollo:
(She's doing great! Keep it up, Trucy!)

Trucy:
But in the years I've known Mr. Gavin, I learned he is just like Daddy and other Daddy.
Like, you know, he has the worst qualities from both of them!
Tee hee! One time at a dinner party, a waiter spilled Mr. Gavin's wine.
He was so furious, I'm surprised his pants didn't light on fire! Zak-level anger.
And just like Phoenix, he's a bit oblivious sometimes. It's really funny.
He took me for a stupid child, and never realized I didn't trust him one bit.

Kristoph:
...

Trucy:
So Mr. Gavin is like Phoenix and Zak, but in all the wrong ways.
The overcooked, soggy vegetables without the gourmet dessert, you know?
The kind of meal that just makes your tummy sick.

Kristoph:
...!

Apollo:
(Just a little more!)
Is there anything else you'd like to add, Ms. Wright?

Trucy:
Hmm... Oh! I should talk about the first time we met, I guess.
Right in this very courthouse!

Kristoph:
!
Miss Wright... I suggest you stop this instant.
What would happen if the world learned that the future of Troupe Gramarye committed libel?

Trucy:
I'm sorry, Mr. Gavin, but that spell you cast on Prosecutor Gavin won't work on me.
I'm a magician, after all. As long as I'm around, you'll never be in control.

Kristoph:
You... Nngh.

Klavier:
K-Kristoph...

Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin!
(Kristoph's spell is weakening! We're almost there!)
Ms. Wright, please finish your account.

Trucy:
Why, I'd love to!
Because in this very courtroom, seven years ago...
Right before the trial of Zak Gramarye, a man gave me evidence...
Evidence I later learned was forged, and told me to hand it to Phoenix Wright.
Mr. Gavin! The man with the forged evidence was you!

Kristoph:
...
Nonsense.
Will the court truly accept this fraudulent, irrelevant testimony...
Testimony, delivered by the defense's own co-counsel?
Klavier.

Klavier:
...Unfortunately... the prosecution must... concur with the witness.

Apollo:
(He looks like he's gasping for air!)

Trucy:
That's alright. This isn't official testimony.
I'm only here to say, Mr. Gavin...
That the stupid 8 year-old child, directly descended from the great Zak Gramarye, who you murdered...
And from the great Phoenix Wright, who you maliciously disbarred...
That child, Trucy Enigmar Gramarye Wright, has played you for a fool!

Kristoph:
!!!
Wright is a low-life boor who deserved his expulsion, not his success.
And Zak, nothing but a conceited dimwit who played at being a god.
I pity you, wretched girl, for being indoctrinated by them.
If you had any sense of morality, you never would've corrupted my star student.
Yet here he is, dragged along by the horns into this unprofessional farce.

Trucy:
...

Apollo:
...

Judge:
...

Klavier:
...
Lost that cool you're so proud of because of a teenager, eh, Kristoph?

Kristoph:
...Your Honor, it is finally time for me to return to my cell.

Judge:
As you wish. Bailiff!

Objection!

Apollo:
I believe this is the part of the story where the "star student" surpasses the teacher, Mr. Gavin.

Kristoph:
What now, Justice? I'd appreciate it if you stopped buzzing in my ear.

Apollo:
There is a procedural rule you might have heard of, Mr. Gavin.
If a witness gives testimony, the defense is entitled to a cross-examination.
And unless I'm mistaken, you just went on an interesting little rant... from the witness stand.
Your Honor! The defense requests to cross-examine the witness's recent statements!

Judge:
I never thought I'd see another lawyer with such a talent for the unexpected.
Yet here you are, Mr. Justice.
Very well. Request granted.

Kristoph:
Nngh!
...The generous man that I am, I will oblige this absurdity.

Apollo:
We did it, Trucy! You were incredible back there!

Trucy:
I knew I was right to believe in you. Nice smile, by the way!

Apollo:
Heh heh.
(You'll have a whole fan club soon, Justice!)
But, uh...
You knew all along it was Mr. Gavin who gave you the diary page, Trucy?

Trucy:
Of course I didn't. The guy with the evidence was in some weird disguise.
I just took an educated guess.

Apollo:
You lied? In court!?

Trucy:
Shh, Apollo! Lecture me after you win, OK?

Apollo:
Right.
(One final push, and this seven year-old boulder will be up Gavin hill!)

Judge:
Witness. Repeat your previous testimony, if you would.

Kristoph:
...As you wish, Your Honor.


--An Evil Man, Ignited--
Wright is a low-life boor who deserved his expulsion, not his success.

And Zak, nothing but a conceited dimwit who played at being a god.

I pity you, wretched girl, for being indoctrinated by them.

If you had any sense of morality, you never would've corrupted my star student.

Yet here he is, dragged along by the horns into this unprofessional farce.


Klavier:
I apologize for going kaput for a moment, Herr Forehead.
Luckily for me, I had you and Fraulein Wright to unclog my exhaust pipe...
Of this wicked ghost known as the past.

Apollo:
Don't mention it, Prosecutor Gavin. We're on the same team.
(This testimony doesn't have much to do with the details of the case...)
(But it has everything to do with Vera walking free.)
(This is a battle for the hearts of the jurists!)
(And now, like always, I won't pull any punches in cross-examination...)
(Because you taught me that, Mr. Gavin!)

Trucy:
These long seven years... it'll be over soon, Daddy.

Judge:
It is my responsibility, too, to see the truth of this case brought to light.
Proceed with your final cross-examination, Mr. Justice.


--An Evil Man, Ignited--
Wright is a low-life boor who deserved his expulsion, not his success.

Press:
By "expulsion," do you mean expulsion from the Bar Association?

Kristoph:
Naturally.

Apollo:
According to public records, exactly one person voted against his expulsion.
That one person seven years ago was you, Mr. Gavin.
Why would you take a stand against his disbarment then, but support it now?

Kristoph:
To err is human, to forgive divine, Justice.
I believe in second chances, and I used my best judgment at the time.
Yet as I became acquainted with Wright, I slowly realized how mistaken I'd been.
I am eternally grateful to my former colleagues for seeing through his facade.

Klavier:
Or, perhaps, you voted against his disbarment to disguise your role in it.
You yourself expressed anger that Herr Zak hired Herr Wright for that case.
May we assume that you regret that little faux pas of yours?

Kristoph:
Again with the baseless accusations, Klavier?
Honestly, you're like a pit bull on the scent of its owner rather than its prey.
If you're any prosecutor, focus on the murderer on trial...
Not an irrelevant event from seven years ago.

Apollo:
I'd hardly call an incident resulting from the defendant's forgery irrelevant.
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Gavin?

Kristoph:
I'd agree that Wright was disbarred for using the murderer's forgery.
But that has nothing to do with how I voted on the matter, now does it?

Trucy:
You commissioned that forgery and gave it to Daddy through me.

Kristoph:
Miss Trucy, surely you have learned about Occam's Razor in school.
You could believe that I commissioned it, although Zak never hired me...
...and trusted my evil scheme to a mere child's cooperation.
Or you could believe that your father, who is registered on the docket, did.
Which possibility, I ask, requires the fewer leaps of logic?

Apollo:
(He's twisting all our words and facts around like he was born to do it.)
(If this keeps up, the jurists might be swayed by his personality.)
(His composure is fallible. Trucy's performance showed us.)
(Now it's up to me to pry the jaws of this scam wide open!)

---------------------
And Zak, nothing but a conceited dimwit who played at being a god.

Press:
So the one who killed Zak was...?

Kristoph:
Certainly not me. I killed "Shadi Smith."
Must you insist on rehashing this?

Apollo:
It was proven in April that you killed Shadi Smith, who turned out to be Zak!

Kristoph:
"Who turned out to be" are the key words, I'd say.
If it is true that this stranger was that individual -- I've seen no material proof.

Apollo:
(...Because we have none. Because there are no records. Because of course.)
You had the motive, means, and opportunity to kill Zak... and you did!
You can't seriously tell us it was a coincidence?

Kristoph:
Fate weaves her thread in strange ways.
Say, Justice -- what do you like to eat for breakfast?

Apollo:
Uh... er...
(Where did that come from?)
Usually some cereal with a cup of joe, I guess.

Kristoph:
I see. And you, Miss Trucy?

Trucy:
Toast with butter for me. Nutritious and delicious!

Kristoph:
I see. And you, Your Honor?

Judge:
Why, my wife makes the most heavenly eggs and bakey.

Trucy:
He doesn't seriously think it's called "bakey", does he?

Apollo:
Don't put it past him.

Judge:
Quite the scrumptious start to a day of judging, indeed.
In fact, when I don't get my eggs and bakey...
I'm so upset, I sometimes declare a defendant guilty right away!

Kristoph:
...Very fascinating.
And I have no need to ask my little brother:
He prefers rolls with cheese, cold cuts, and marmalade.

Apollo:
And what does this have to do with your testimony?

Kristoph:
I wasn't aware my testimony had anything to do with the case, either.

Apollo:
(Urk.)

Kristoph:
But what do I partake in for breakfast?
Well, sometimes the urge strikes me... for murder.

Trucy:
...

Apollo:
(...You're a real wacko, G.)

Kristoph:
Quite an insatiable desire, I hope you understand.
Just like His Honor with his eggs and bakey.

Judge:
Oh, yes! I understand!

Kristoph:
As you see, we all desire different breakfasts.
I'm simply an evil man who yearns for murder. I need no other reason.
And Shadi Smith so happened to be my meal that day.
Hence, my residence in solitary, before you so rudely summoned me.

Apollo:
I'm sorry, Trucy...
(She looks like she's about to kill someone herself.)

Trucy:
Remember, don't worry about me, Apollo.
But I despise weasel-tongued, silver-worded adults.

Apollo:
Hey! Why are you glaring at me?
...And I think you flop-flipped your phrases there, by the way.
(But it's true, we can't let him keep slipping out from under our questioning.)
(I need a way to show the jurists exactly what kind of man he is, and fast!)

---------------------
I pity you, wretched girl, for being indoctrinated by them.

Press:
Witness! You will refrain from further disparaging Ms. Wright!

Trucy:
Polly! I can handle him! You're embarrassing me!

Kristoph:
Defense. I will do no such thing.
I am merely expressing my knowledge and opinions as they are.
Or would you prefer I lie?

Klavier:
Alas, he speaks truly.
You cannot protect Fraulein Wright from comment, Herr Forehead.
Allow me to suggest that you protect instead the entire world...
...And whisk the Devil back to solitary, a fresh indictment in tow.

Apollo:
(Great. Want some fries with that order too?)
(And carrying the entire world? Might as well change my name to Atlas.)

Kristoph:
A lesson you fail to remember, Justice.
In our profession, there are "feelings," and then there are "facts."
I admire your care for Miss Trucy, parented by conmen though she may be.
You remind me of myself with my younger brother.

Klavier:
The big bro you used to be, you now are not, Kristoph.

Kristoph:
Let's save the family chit-chat for another time, yes?
Regardless, Justice.
Our job is to defend those requesting our aid, nothing more, nothing less.
Once the verdict is handed down, only then may a lawyer feel.
Facts govern the verdict of this case. Logical, concrete facts.
For your client's sake... and for the sake of my patience...
I suggest you perform your duty first and fawn over Miss Trucy later.

Trucy:
Don't worry, Apollo, I'll fawn over you too, once this is all over.
All you have to do... is send the Devil back to Hell.

Apollo:
(Great. Want some ketchup with those fries, too?)
(And banishing the Devil? Might as well change my name to... uh...)
(...Maybe I'm not as up on my literary allusions as I thought.)
(Regardless, I need a foothold here.)

Trucy:
Would one of Mr. Gavin's statements just now help?

Apollo:
(Hmm... there was one part that struck me.)
("Once the verdict is handed down, only then may a lawyer feel.")
(What should I do?)
Your Honor, the witness's maxim about lawyers...
The defense requests that he add it to his testimony!

Judge:
Very well.

---------------------
If you had any sense of morality, you never would've corrupted my star student.

Press:
To clarify, this "star student" of yours...

Kristoph:
Is you, Justice.

Apollo:
(I thought so, but... ha ha!)

Trucy:
Apollo, did you forget he's a murderer?

Apollo:
Um...

Klavier:
Herr Forehead, did you forget he got your mentor disbarred?

Apollo:
Er...

Judge:
Defense, did you forget you're supposed to do your job?

Apollo:
Uh...
(I guess Mr. Gavin still has some influence over me after all...)
(Changing tack here.)
Witness! What do you mean by Ms. Wright "corrupting" me?

Kristoph:
To begin with, she provided you with that fraudulent evidence, Justice.
I'm not dense.

Judge:
Fraudulent evidence!? Where!?

Apollo:
Wh-Which fraudulent evidence, Mr. Gavin?
(No no no! Not this! Not now!)

Trucy:
I don't know of any fraudulent evidence.

Klavier:
Ah, yes... the "forged ace." The virus that should've withered Herr Forehead's career...
...Before it even fluttered out of its nest.
Or so Kristoph told me, at the time.
But now, I know what weight his words regarding forgery carry.
Certainly less heavy than my heart... but equal to my belief in his claim.

Apollo:
(Phew. That was a close shave.)
(...But now I feel even guiltier. I gotta have a stern talk with Trucy later.)

Kristoph:
...Regardless.
Wright and his "daughter" are twin poisons devouring your intellect from within.
Chasing fairytales? Fraternizing with the rabble and the refuse?
All while displaying flagrant disregard for duty and procedure.
At least your badge remains polished enough to serve as a mirror.
Looking into it would do you some good, I believe.

Apollo:
If you'd like to talk about poison, look no further than yourself.
The atroquinine that took the victim's life...
And the venom that plunged those involved in the Gramarye trial into a long darkness.
Poison that I'm here to purge.

Kristoph:
I'd be more interested in evidence than a heroic monologue about good and evil.
Of course, you have nothing to prove Ms. Misham innocent... or me guilty.

Apollo:
(So he says, but is that really true?)
(Should I ask for that statement to be added to the testimony?)
Your Honor, the defense requests that statement be added to the testimony.

Judge:
Very well. Request accepted.

---------------------
Yet here he is, dragged along by the horns into this unprofessional farce.

Press:
On what grounds do you call this an "unprofessional farce"?
It sounds to me like you're lashing out because you see you're in a corner.

Kristoph:
All I see, in this moment...
Is the defense conspiring to upset me to justify a pointless cross-examination.
Surely you recognize this as a breach of decorum, Your Honor?

Judge:
Indeed, I recognize it.
I suggest the defense wrap up its cross-examination... before I do.

Apollo:
(Ack!)
This cross-examination is vitally important for establishing the witness' character!

Kristoph:
And now I see a bluff. The fruit of my teaching has been undone, I see.

Apollo:
I'm the same lawyer you mentored, Mr. Gavin.
The one who never holds back. Who places trust in the courtroom above all else.
But in my six-month journey, I've discovered so much.
And I refuse to lose everything again!

Trucy:
Apollo...

Klavier:
Good show, Herr Forehead. Time for us to protect what we have left, ja?

Kristoph:
As for what I wish to see:
If you can still call yourself a lawyer, Justice, I'd like to see you prove it.

Trucy:
Do you see a possibility of that statement helping us out?

Apollo:
(I se--
Er, anyway. What should I do?)
The defense requests that the witness add that statement to the testimony!

Judge:
Very well. I see.

---------------------
Extra statement 1:
Once the verdict is handed down, only then may a lawyer feel.

Press:
It sounds to me like 

---------------------
Extra statement 2:
Of course, you have nothing to prove Ms. Misham innocent... or me guilty.
---------------------
Extra statement 3:
If you can still call yourself a lawyer, Justice, I'd like to see you prove it.




Judge:
Witness! Please add that statement to your testimony.

---------------------
Extra statement 4:
Right or wrong, 
---------------------
Hint conversation:
---------------------

Trucy:
We need something -- anything -- to cast Mr. Gavin in a bad light.

Apollo:
And us and Prosecutor Gavin, in a good one.
But it won't be easy.

Trucy:
Something that will definitely open the jurists' eyes to the truth.

Apollo:
They've already seen the MASON System and all our evidence, though.
I'm struggling to think of what more to do.

Trucy:
That's exactly it, Apollo. They've seen the MASON System and all our evidence.
They're teetering on the ledge. We just have to give 'em a good shove!

Apollo:
(Not the metaphor I'd have chosen, but...)
Something that rips away the veneer of Mr. Gavin's persausiveness.
In other words, we've powered on the igniter, but we need to set it full blast.

Trucy:
This cross-examination is unique, but we pack the heat through contradictions...
...Just like we always have.
I believe in you, Apollo! So show the world your smile!

Apollo:
(Right! About to pass out from anxiety, but the jurists will only see my hope.)
(This cross-examination is our final chance. We're already stretching it.)
(The Wrights, Prosecutor Gavin, the Gramaryes, the Mishams...)
(I don't know how I ended up here, but now that I'm here, I know what to do.)
(The seven-year darkness... I'm here to end it!)




I've learned that in this world, there's rarely black and white.
But that doesn't mean there's no wrong or right.
It doesn't mean that we should give up on following the fire in our heart.







Jurists, you say...?

...

Incidentally, the one responsible for making this happen...
Was Phoenix Wright.

Phoe... Phoenix Wright?
(Psyche-Lock breaking sound)
So... Everything was leading to this. Of course... Right...
(yelling)


I won't accept... I can't accept... This is no court!
...
You'd let ignorant swine soil your courts?
No! No! No! If I'm convicted, I'll appeal! Again and again!

And the people will convict you, again and again...
As many times as you rear your ugly head in envy.

Truth! There's only one, immutable truth!
Truth can't be determined by this incoherent herd!

The truth is complex and variable, Mr. Gavin. It's rarely as it seems.
And this is the truth I've decided:
I hope you enjoy rotting the rest of your life away in prison.
Goodbye.

This is just...? Justice... Justice! Justice! I demand justice!

Wish granted, Mr. Gavin.
Because Justice is right here, and just what you're about to get.

I... but...!

A lesson you fail to remember, Mr. Gavin.
Excess yelling can damage the jurists' ears... and your case.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhh!

(music fades out)
Kristoph... It's over.



Father... Mother... I hope I can look in your eyes again.
