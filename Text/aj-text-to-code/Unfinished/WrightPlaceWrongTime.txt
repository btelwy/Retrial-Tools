Month Day, 8:23 AM
Wright Anything Agency

Apollo: 
Trucy! Mr. Wright!
Trucy! Mr. Wright! Where are you?

TV Announcer:
...can expect to see storms moving into the...

Apollo:
I got your call! A-Are you OK!? 

(Trucy and Phoenix appear and look distressed)

Trucy: 
No, Apollo, it's a disaster! If this keeps up, I—

Apollo: 
What? What is it!? T-Tell me! 

(Trucy gasps and falls over) 

Apollo: 
T-Trucy! 

Phoenix: 
It's... her homework. 

Apollo: 
...What?

Phoenix: 
The schoolwork she's assigned to do at home.

Apollo: 
No, I get that, but—

Phoenix: 
She needs help with her homework. Thanks for showing up on a day off, Apollo. You're a dependable guy.

Apollo:
You two, your— youre— no, I mean, you're—

(Trucy gets up)

Trucy:
Darn, you're stumped too, huh? I was hoping you could help with my grammar homework. Guess I'll have to ask elsewhere, though.

Apollo:
(...insane. You two are insane.)

TV Announcer:
...right, Mike. If you're in Los Angeles, get ready for a very wet day.

Apollo:
OK, uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... but if no one's dying, I really should be on my way.
I mean, I have plans, you know.
(Think of something, Justice, pronto!)
I have to go, uh...
(On a date? To do my laundry?)
To a gaming tournament! 
I'm competing at a gaming tournament!

Trucy:
Ooh! Like how Daddy plays poker because he doesn't have a job?

Apollo:
Yeah, exactly like that. Because with your rates, being unemployed wouldn't be much worse.
I would know. I've been unemployed.

Phoenix:
Trucy, how do you feel about giving Apollo a raise? Recently we've had a little spare cash lying around.

Trucy:
I'm not against it, Daddy, but we have to run this through the proper channels.
Last time I tried to give Apollo a raise, the union rejected it because it didn't match inflation.

Apollo:
What!? We're unionized?
(Where was this when she was making me dig through trash cans?)

Phoenix:
Yes, we're unionized, aren't we, Trucy?
The Wright Anything Agency Workers.

Trucy:
Yes, the W.A.A.W.! ...I wanted to give union busting a shot, but it didn't work out.

Apollo:
(You're dreaming. You must be dreaming.)

Trucy:
Oh, Mr. Union Manager, sir!

...

Apollo:
...Who are you talking to?

Trucy:
Oh, Mr. Charley Union Manager, sir!

...

Apollo:
You're talking to the plant. The union manager.

Trucy:
...
So the union has approved the raise? 
...
But what, there's an added condition?

Apollo:
What?

Trucy:
...
We can only give Apollo the raise if he stays with us for the entire day? OK, I'll tell him!
Apollo, the W.A.A.W. says we can only give you the raise if you stay with us for the entire day!

Apollo:
That's... not how unions work. In so many ways.
Look, I've got to bike over to my... gaming tournament. So...

TV Announcer:
Thunderstorms of unprecedented magnitude are expected to last until sundown in—

(BOOM!)
(power goes out)

Phoenix:
So, Apollo, what game were you going to play?

Apollo:
Uh... Sleet Fighter. A classic fighting game with an ice physics twist.

Phoenix:
That's nice. Looks like it's not happening now, though.

Apollo:
(...Not that it was happening anyway.)
(Breathe in. Breathe out.)
(You're in your happy place, Justice.)

Trucy:
This is great, Polly! You can stay with us for the day!

Apollo:
Y-You two, their's not... no, they're's not... no, I mean, there's not—

Trucy:
Huh. Looks like you still can't help me with my grammar homework, though.

Apollo:
(...There's no one with more screws loose than you two, I swear.)

Trucy:
Ooh, ghost story time! Me first!
Come one, come all, sit and behold the tales of horror that will be related to your ears!
Now, once upon a time, in the distant kingdom of the W.A.A.'s bathroom...

...

Phoenix:
And as I turned to flee, the nightmarish, behemoth judge smashed me with his giant gavel.
The ground crumbling around me, I fell into the chasm... and twisted my wrist.
And that wraps up my turn.

Trucy:
Scared, Polly?

Apollo:
As if. I only learned a bit more than I wanted to about the bathroom...
And that Mr. Wright should probably see a therapist.

Phoenix:
That story is an old classic from back in the day. Even when a chapter of your life is behind you, there are some spooky ghosts that never leave.

Apollo:
Alright, I guess it's my turn, huh?
Listen up then, because this is how you spin a real hair-raiser.
This one comes from back when my friend Clay and I were in junior high...
And it's more terrifying than junior high itself.
And make no mistake about it, it's 100 percent true.

(I'll fill this in)

The ghost ate boys and girls in junior high... girls, in fact, much like yourself, Trucy.

Trucy:
N-No!
...

Phoenix:
You OK there, Truce?
Oh no, she's not getting eaten, is she?
Because I really wouldn't want to fill out that paperwork.

Apollo:
(That's his first thought? I'll never understand him.)
Indeed, she's being devoured by a ghost at this very moment.

Trucy:
...

Apollo:
Oh come on Trucy, I'm sorry I'm so talented, but it's just a ghost story.
A story. You know, made up.

Trucy:
...

Apollo:
...If any ghosts ever try to eat you, I'll scare them away with my Chords of Steel.

Trucy:
Oh! That makes me feel better. Thank you, Polly!

Apollo:
(That's what made her feel better? I'll never understand her.)

(lights turn back on, but the rain is still going)

Phoenix:
Well, I had a good time, but I don't want to miss my daily appointment with the sofa.
You kids have fun.

Apollo:
(...And he's already snoring.)
Wow. Mr. Wright's out like a light.
TRUCY:
I know! Daddy's been going to sleep earlier and earlier. He said it's because he's working on something really cool.
APOLLO:
(What could be “cool” as a piano player?!)
TRUCY:
That or your ghost story was so boring it put him to sleep.
APOLLO:
H-hey! I've improved my storytelling skills! It managed to scare you!
TRUCY:
Polly! That's not fair!
APOLLO:
You know what they say. Turnabout is fair play.

(A low rumble sounds)

APOLLO:
Huh? What was that?
TRUCY:
Teehee! It was probably my stomach. Daddy was supposed to make some food once I finished my homework. But then we decided to call you and... you know the rest.
APOLLO:
I see. Well, do you have any food here?
TRUCY:
Daddy brought some ingredients for something. They should be in the fridge over there!
APOLLO:
Alright. How about I make you something?
TRUCY:
You can cook, Polly?
APOLLO:
Well... yeah. I have to eat somehow.
TRUCY:
You're not a frequent customer of Mr. Eldoon?
APOLLO:
If I was, I'd be dead. 
TRUCY:
I guess so.
APOLLO:
Back to the point. Where's the fridge?
TRUCY:
Over here! Just gotta step over some of my magic stuff.
APOLLO:
It's like an obstacle course here! Do you come over here often?
TRUCY:
Not anymore. I tried making a grilled cheese sandwich once and nearly burned the office down! Now Daddy doesn't let me back here without an adult. 
APOLLO:
(How do you— You know what, some questions are better left unanswered.) Alright. Let's see what we've got. Potatoes, onions, carrots, stock... Was Mr. Wright going to make you stew?
TRUCY:
How did you know?
APOLLO:
These are all ingredients I use when I make stew. Wow, you even have sour cream! I've never seen someone else use sour cream for stew.
TRUCY:
The recipe I use calls for it.
APOLLO:
Really? Where's it from?
TRUCY:
I don't know! 
APOLLO:
Lovely.
I wrote it down so I don't forget it. Here you go!
APOLLO:
OK... Looks like we're missing some paprika. We'll have to use something else as a substitute.
TRUCY:
Don't worry about that, Polly! I could get some from my magic pan—
APOLLO:
NO.
TRUCY:
What's the matter?
APOLLO:
I can make it work, Trucy. I never want to hear about those things ever again.
TRUCY:
The Kitaki case dredges up some bad memories for you?
APOLLO:
In a sense. Anyway, let's get started. I'll cut on the meat and you can start... Uh... Counting the vegetables. 
TRUCY:
Can't I get a real job, Polly?
APOLLO:
I want to make sure that you don't get hurt. I don't need Mr. Wright sending me to an early grave. 
TRUCY:
I'm sure Daddy would understand. It's his fault he didn't make food beforehand.
APOLLO:
(Please don't let me regret this.) Fine, Trucy. You can peel the vegetables. Make sure you don't cut yourself.
TRUCY:
Thank you, Polly! 

(Trucy brings out Mr. Hat.) 

MR. HAT:
I shall supervise Miss Trucy as an extra precaution.
APOLLO:
Thanks, “Mr. Hat”.
MR. HAT:
My pleasure, Mr. Justice!
APOLLO:
(As eccentric as Mr. Wright and Trucy are, I'm starting to get used to being around them. Maybe landing this job wasn't so bad, after all.)
TRUCY:
Polly! Come over here!
APOLLO:
What is it?
TRUCY:
I nicked my finger.
APOLLO:
Oh boy. (And there it is.) *sigh* It's fine. I'll get a bandage for you. Did any blood get on the veggies?
TRUCY:
A little got on the carrots. But that should just add more flavor!
APOLLO:
Trucy. That's not how that works. At all.
TRUCY:
But isn't that why you're not supposed to cook a steak all the way through? So the blood mixes with the seasonings!
APOLLO:
Vegetables and meat are completely different things! Whatever. Let's just get you cleaned up before Mr. Wright wakes up. 

(Beat)

APOLLO:
And... there we go!
TRUCY:
Thanks, Polly!
APOLLO:
Enough distractions. Let's get this stew finished.

(Fade to black. Various clattering or clanking sound effects are heard. After a few seconds, we fade back in.)

APOLLO:
It only took five hours, but we're finally done.
TRUCY:
Wow... It looks delicious, Polly!
APOLLO:
Let's hope it tastes as good as it looks. YIKES! That's hot!
TRUCY:
You probably shouldn't have eaten it immediately after it came out of the pan.
APOLLO:
Now you tell me.

(PHOENIX enters the scene again.)

APOLLO:
Oh! Mr. Wright! You're up.
PHOENIX:
Indeed I am. Your Chords of Steel jolted me out of my much needed sleep.
APOLLO:
Oh. Sorry about that.
TRUCY:
Look, Daddy! Polly and I made stew!
PHOENIX:
Did you now? I've been kinda peckish lately, so I'll help myself...
APOLLO:
Wait! We just finished so it's—
PHOENIX:
...
APOLLO:
(He— He ate an entire spoonful! How is his mouth not burning?!)
PHOENIX:
...Paprika.
APOLLO:
Huh?
PHOENIX:
There's not any paprika.
APOLLO:
Oh... About that. You didn't have any so I used cayenne pepper instead.
TRUCY:
I want to use my magic—
APOLLO:
I didn't want to run out to get some. Especially with the storm.
PHOENIX:
Well, Apollo, paprika notwithstanding, you and Trucy did a good job.
TRUCY:
Aw... Thanks, Daddy!
MR. HAT:
Don't forget about me, good sir! I, the fantastic Mr. Hat also helped!
PHOENIX:
Thank you as well, Mr. Hat.
TV ANNOUNCER:
The sudden rainstorm has passed. Flash flood warnings are still in effect, but travel is otherwise unrestricted.
APOLLO:
Well, looks like I've got to head out.
TRUCY:
Wait, Polly! Before you go!
APOLLO:
What's up?
Take some stew with you. You made most of it after all.
APOLLO:
Aw... Thanks Trucy! (How kind. I'm glad she acknowledged my contribution.)
PHOENIX:
Good idea, Trucy. After all, there's some big things going on besides. We don't need any of our employees starving, right, Trucy?
TRUCY:
Of course! Polly needs all the strength he can get so he can do paperwork all day!
APOLLO:
(And there it is. There's always an ulterior motive with those two.) Yep. Gotta have plenty of energy. For paperwork.
