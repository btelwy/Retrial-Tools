Apollo's Apartment

{sound:door}
{name:apollo}
Home sweet home.{wait:normal} Well,{wait:short} that's{newLine}
what they say,{wait:short} anyway.{textboxEnd}
Feels like a lie right now.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Not your fault,{wait:short} though,{wait:short}{newLine}
apartment. Everything does.{textboxEnd}
Surprised I didn't crash my bike{newLine}
riding over here.{wait:normal} I was squeezing{newLine}
that thing like a vise.{textboxEnd}
Would've been the cherry on{newLine}
top of the mess I'd always{newLine}
dreamed would be a cake.{textboxEnd}
Alright,{wait:short} here's the plan.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I lie down,{wait:short} and when I{newLine}
wake up...{textboxEnd}
{textColor:blue}
(...when I wake up,{wait:short} maybe the{newLine}
pit in my chest will be{newLine}
gone.){textboxEnd}
(Maybe I can still dream.){textboxEnd}

(he lies down)

(Maybe I should call Clay.{wait:normal}{newLine}
He'd know what to do...{wait:normal}{newLine}
but...){textboxEnd}
(...geez,{wait:short} I'm zonked out.){textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
{sound:outburst}Heya Pollo,{wait:short} what's down?{wait:3B}{wait:3B}{textboxEndForced}
I really wanted to call earlier{newLine}
to check in about how it{newLine}
went,{wait:short} but,{wait:short} uh--{wait:3B}{wait:3B}{textboxEndForced}
Director Cosmos needed some help{newLine}
with one of the robots,{wait:short} well,{wait:short}{newLine}
uh,{wait:short} still kinda needs.{wait:3B}{wait:3B}{textboxEndForced}
Y'know, 'cuz I sorta dropped ten{newLine}
screws inside the solar panel.{wait:normal}{newLine}
So he said--{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
{sound:punctuate}Whoa,{wait:short} {sound:punctuate}whoa,{wait:short} hold up there!{wait:normal}{newLine}
Can't I get a word or two in?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Ha ha ha,{wait:short} forgot myself again,{wait:short}{newLine}
Pollo.{wait:normal} My bad,{wait:short} my bad.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
"My bad" my behind.{wait:normal} We both{newLine}
know perfectly well that you{newLine}
do it just to be annoying.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Then it sounds like it's{newLine}
doing its job!{wait:normal} Unlike me!{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}{textColor:blue}
(I can just imagine his{newLine}
sheepish grin.){textboxEnd}
(And... oh,{wait:short} darn it.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Now I'm smiling too.){textColor:white}
And we both know perfectly{newLine}
well that you ace your job.(textboxEnd)
So no need to make fun{newLine}
of yourself for my sake.{textboxEnd}
I mean,{wait:short} how long until you go{newLine}
into space?{wait:normal} December of{newLine}
next year?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Yep,{wait:short} just about eighteen{newLine}
months from now.{textboxEnd}
But no joke,{wait:short} Pollo,{wait:short} I gotta{newLine}
tell you the rest of{newLine}
this story.{textboxEnd}
Excuse my language, but it's{newLine}
epic as heck.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Fine,{wait:short} fine.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
So,{wait:short} look,{wait:short} Director Cosmos has this{newLine}
huge drawer of screws that{newLine}
only he can tell apart.{textboxEnd}
And,{wait:short} I mean,{wait:short} he did document{newLine}
which is which,{wait:short} but get this!{wait:normal}{newLine}
He did it on {sound:punctuate}paper.{textboxEnd}
Paper!{wait:normal} In this day and age!{textboxEnd}
And his handwriting looks like{newLine}
that time I made you do{newLine}
your math homework blindfolded!{textboxEnd}
How could I have known{newLine}
which one to use?{textboxEnd}
How in the ever-expanding{newLine}
universe could I have{newLine}
known,{wait:short} Pollo?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Allow me to translate:{wait:normal} "I grabbed{newLine}
them all at once to figure{newLine}
out which one fit."{textboxEnd}
"Shockingly,{wait:short} I was unable to{newLine}
hold seventy-two screws."{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Hey,{wait:short} efficiency is{newLine}
proficiency.{textboxEnd}
It's just that I didn't expect{newLine}
gravity to betray me like that.{textboxEnd}
I swear,{wait:short} this is why{newLine}
I'm going to space.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
More like your brain betrayed{newLine}
you.{wait:normal} Are you getting a{newLine}
new one in space?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Who knows?{wait:normal} The possibilities{newLine}
are endless.{textboxEnd}
More importantly,{wait:short} how did it{newLine}
go today?{textboxEnd}
Hey, one more time,{wait:short} I'm{newLine}
so sorry I couldn't be there.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I just can't miss training.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollp}
Honestly...{wait:normal}{newLine}
I'm glad you weren't there.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Something wrong,{wait:short} Pollo?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Yeah...{wait:normal} speaking of "betraying."{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
{sound:ding}Huh?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
What if I tell you that...{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That the two people I looked{newLine}
up to the most of anyone{newLine}
betrayed me today?{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That Mr. Wright gave me forged{newLine}
evidence that could've gotten{newLine}
me disbarred?{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That the rumors about him{newLine}
forging evidence in his last{newLine}
trial are probably true?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}{textSpeed:F}
...{textboxEnd}{textSpeed:3}

{name:apollo}
What if I tell you that{newLine}
I lost my job?{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That I was so furious I{newLine}
punched Mr. Wright in the face?{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That...{wait:normal} {sound:punctuate}that...{textboxEnd}
{sound:outburst}That in my very first trial,{wait:short}{newLine}
Mr. Gavin turned out to be{newLine}
a real,{wait:short} live murderer?!{textboxEnd}
{name:clay}
...{textboxEnd}
{textbox:hide}
{wait:3B}
{textbox:show}
It's OK,{wait:short} Pollo.{newLine}
I'm here.{textboxEnd}
{textbox:hide}
{wait:3B}

{name:apollo}
*sob* *sniff* *bawl* *sob*{textboxEnd}
{textbox:hide}
{wait:3B}
{textbox:show}
{textColor:blue}(So much for staying cool.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
S-Sorry for l-losing it there.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I didn't mean to take{newLine}
it out on you.{textboxEnd}
{name:clay}
Pollo...{wait:normal} I can't believe they{newLine}
did that to you.{textSpeed:F}
.........{textboxEnd}
.........{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}{textSpeed:3}
C-Clay?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Bless your heart,{wait:short} Pollo,{wait:short} I'm not mad.{textboxEnd}
I mean,{wait:short} I'm furious,{wait:short} too.{wait:normal}{newLine}
But not at you.{wait:normal} For you.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
For some reason,{wait:short} that actually{newLine}
makes me feel better.{textboxEnd}
Thanks,{wait:short} Clay.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
No prob.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Seriously,{wait:short} are you OK though?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
You'd think after a few hours{newLine}
it would process...{textboxEnd}
But judging by my tears,{wait:short} I'd{newLine}
give it another week or so.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
And that's alright.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
It isn't even the first time{newLine}
someone has betrayed my trust.{textboxEnd}
So why am I sad that{newLine}
it happened again?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Because it's sad every time,{wait:short}{newLine}
Pollo.{wait:normal} Life is pretty sad,{wait:short}{newLine}
isn't it?{textboxEnd}
That's why I'm here to{newLine}
brighten it up for you.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}{textColor:blue}
(I don't know where I'd{newLine}
be without you,{wait:short} Clay.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
And I'm here to remind{newLine}
you to be responsible,{wait:short} since{newLine}
you have a few screws loose.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Yeah,{wait:short} that generally does happen{newLine}
when you drop them.{textboxEnd}
Changing subject.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Can you not think of a{newLine}
better transition?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Nope.{textboxEnd}
What are you gonna do now that{newLine}
you're unemployed?{wait:normal} Need any{newLine}
help?{wait:normal} You're welcome to crash.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
I appreciate it,{wait:short} but luckily{newLine}
I have some emergency cash{newLine}
and...{wait:normal} well,{wait:short} an offer.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Nice,{wait:short} where's the offer at?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
I don't think I'm ready to{newLine}
tell you,{wait:short} honestly. I've got to...{wait:normal}{newLine}
think through some things first.{textboxEnd}
But I will.{wait:normal}I {sound:punctuate}promise.{textboxEnd}
{textColor:blue}(I'm just too ashamed to{newLine}
say it out loud.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}

{name:clay}
Roger that.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Hey.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Now what kind of transition{newLine}
is that?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
You knew,{wait:short} didn't you?{wait:normal} That{newLine}
the trial didn't go well.{textboxEnd}
Because if it had,{wait:short} I{newLine}
would've called you immediately.{textboxEnd}
That's why you started off{newLine}
with that story.{wait:normal} To make{newLine}
me feel better.{textboxEnd}
I'm right,{wait:short} aren't I?{wait:normal}{newLine}
You can admit it.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
I don't know,{wait:short} admitting that{newLine}
you're right?{wait:normal} I'd rather take{newLine}
off my hat.{textboxEnd}
But uh,{wait:short} maybe.{wait:normal} Yeah.{textboxEnd}
You're one smart cookie,{wait:short} Pollo.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Clay...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}{textColor:blue}
(What does being smart count for,{wait:short}{newLine}
really,{wait:short} when everything's{newLine}
falling apart?){textboxEnd}
(What is all my studying{newLine}
even worth?){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}

{name:clay}
Apollo.{textboxEnd}
Our lives are just beginning.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Our stories are just starting.{textboxEnd}
Whatever happens,{wait:short} wherever we go...{wait:normal}{newLine}
You'll be a star.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I just know it.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
And we'll be a binary{newLine}
system,{wait:short} right?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Right.{wait:normal} Two stars,{wait:short} connected in{newLine}
orbit by each other's gravity.{textboxEnd}
Because even in the depths of{newLine}
space,{wait:short} gravity can still reach.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
...{wait:normal}Then there's nothing left to{newLine}
do but shine.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
There's nothing left to do{newLine}
but shine!{textboxEnd}
Just like that badge pinned{newLine}
on your lapel.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
You're right.{wait:normal} I still have{newLine}
my badge.{wait:normal} I still have{newLine}
everything I've worked for.{textboxEnd}
And people to believe in?{textboxEnd}
Well,{wait:short} I'm at a loss with that.{textboxEnd}
But for now I have you,{wait:short}{newLine}
Clay,{wait:short} and that's more{newLine}
than enough.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Bingo.{wait:normal} Back at you.{textboxEnd}
I trust you,{wait:short} I believe{newLine}
in you,{wait:short} and,{wait:short} uh,{wait:short} I don't{newLine}
really think I've killed anyone.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Filling me with confidence here.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
I sure as heck haven't{newLine}
killed anyone!{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Better.

{name:clay}
And,{wait:short} uh,{wait:short} Pollo?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
Yeah?{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
You'll let me see Mr. Gavin{newLine}
in prison,{wait:short} won't you?{textboxEnd}
I'd love to slug him.{wait:normal} You{newLine}
know,{wait:short} just bruise him up{newLine}
a teeny-tiny bit.{textboxEnd}
It's not fair that{newLine}
Mr. Wright gets all the attention.{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
I'm honored,{wait:short} but I'm not{newLine}
sure I could acquit you from{newLine}
that one.{textboxEnd}

{name:clay}
Phooey.{textboxEnd}
Oops,{wait:short} gotta go,{wait:short} Pollo.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Talk later,{wait:short} OK?{textboxEnd}

{name:apollo}
No problem.{wait:normal} I should{newLine}
be off too.{textboxEnd}
After all...{wait:normal}{newLine}
the world is waiting.{textboxEnd}
