Don't mind the clutter,{wait:short}{newLine}
it's supposed to be there.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
Clutter.{wait:normal} Mr. Wright, what is{newLine}
half of this stuff?{textboxEnd}
Or forget half.{wait:normal} Why does 90{newLine}

like a cartoon junk shop?{textboxEnd}
Random playing cards, a hula{newLine}

{textSpeed:5}is that spaghetti?{textboxEnd}{textSpeed:3}

My daughter's.{wait:normal}{newLine}

(I didn't somehow {sound:punctuate}MISS an{newLine}
entire daughter of his{newLine}

So...{wait:normal} her spaghetti.{wait:normal} Great.{textboxEnd}
What's the deal,{wait:short} Mr. Wright?{wait:normal}{newLine}
I know I was away a few{newLine}
years, but...{textboxEnd}
I didn't hear a word{newLine}
about you not working{newLine}
as a lawyer anymore.{textboxEnd}
Maybe now you hired on{newLine}
some new kid,{wait:short} sure.{textboxEnd}
But I figured you'd keep{newLine}
standing there in the{newLine}
courtroom 'til you retired...{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
Tell me,{wait:short} how much do{newLine}
you know?{wait:normal}{newLine}
About why I stopped.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
...{wait:normal}I know it happened seven{newLine}
years ago,{wait:short} and I know{newLine}
that Gavin was there.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
Ah,{wait:short} Prosecutor Gavin.{wait:normal}{newLine}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
You're right, it was actually{newLine}
his big courtroom debut.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
But I don't think even he{newLine}
was expecting things to{newLine}
go quite like they did.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
And how was that,{wait:short} exactly?{textboxEnd}
No one else seems to{newLine}
have the whole story,{wait:short} so{newLine}
I want to hear it from you.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormalS}
{textSpeed:A}...{textSpeed:3}{wait:20}{newLine}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
It's ancient history at{newLine}
this point,{wait:short} Ema.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{sound:ding}Huh?{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
Some things happened.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I made a few choices.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
{textSpeed:5}Maybe not all of them were{newLine}
the right choices,{textSpeed:3}{wait:short} but I{newLine}
made them all the same.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
They're all in the past.{textboxEnd}

Yeah,{wait:short} no.{wait:normal} You're not{newLine}
pulling this one on me,{wait:short}{newLine}
Mr. Wright.{textboxEnd}
Both of us know it{newLine}
isn't going to work.{textboxEnd}
Something happened to you,{wait:short}{newLine}
and it wasn't just that{newLine}
you made a mistake.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
What,{wait:short} is it hard to believe?{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
Hmph.{wait:normal} A little.{textboxEnd}
It's harder to believe that{newLine}
you'd expect me to let{newLine}
you brush off explaining.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
...{wait:normal}{newLine}
Well.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
Maybe I can stand to say{newLine}
a little more.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Sit down if you want.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{textColor:blue}
(I'm afraid something in here{newLine}
will explode if I do that.){textboxEnd}
(But hey,{wait:short} what's life{newLine}
without a little risk...){textboxEnd}
{-sitting down sound goes here-}
(...OK,{wait:short} no explosions or{newLine}
fireworks yet.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Positive sign.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
Seven years ago.{wait:normal}{newLine}
There was a trial.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
It was a...{wait:normal}{newLine}
last-minute thing for me.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
So?{sound:realization}{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
I thought going into trials{newLine}
grossly underprepared{newLine}
was your whole schtick.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormalS}
{textSpeed:A}...{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
If I were younger,{wait:short} that{newLine}
might have stung a little.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
So,{wait:short} all I had was{newLine}
a rundown of the facts and{newLine}
a glance over the evidence.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
Of course,{wait:short} lucky me that{newLine}
I was up against some{newLine}
total rookie.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
Gavin.{wait:normal} I'd rather not{newLine}
think about him as{newLine}
a teenager.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
Yeah,{wait:short} well...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
Considering he was a rookie{newLine}
taking on his first{newLine}
trial...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
I've got to give him credit.{wait:normal}{newLine}
He kept on top of things.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
In fact,{wait:short} when I brought{newLine}
out my forged evidence,{wait:short} he{newLine}
caught on faster than anyone.{textboxEnd}

not lying to you.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{textSpeed:A}...{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
{music:detentionCenter2001}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
I used forged evidence,{wait:short}{newLine}
or tried to,{wait:short} and it{newLine}
cost me my badge.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
One-and-done,{wait:short} no appeals.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
I'll throw you a bone{newLine}
and pretend I buy that{newLine}
you'd do that.{wait:normal} {sound:realization}Why?{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
I was arrogant.{wait:normal} I thought{newLine}
I had it all worked out,{wait:short}{newLine}
and I got cocky.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
That's...{wait:normal} the opposite of{newLine}
an explanation.{wait:normal} It{newLine}
doesn't answer anything.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixGlaring}
Does it matter,{wait:short} Ema?{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{sound:ding}!{wait:normal}{newLine}
Does it--{wait:normal}... o-of {shake:1}{sound:punctuate}course it{newLine}
matters!{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDownS}
{textSpeed:2}You're {shake:1}{sound:punctuate}supposed to be Phoenix{shake:1}{sound:punctuate}{newLine}
Wright!{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
You...{wait:normal} you help people when{newLine}
they have no one else{newLine}
to turn to!{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
That was then,{wait:short} Ema.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Things change.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{textSpeed:2}That doesn't mean {shake:1}{sound:punctuate}you had to!{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
So they decided that your{newLine}
evidence was a forgery,{wait:short}{newLine}
and you just--{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixGlaring}
Ema.{wait:normal}{wait:normal}{newLine}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
It WAS a forgery.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
You can go ahead and keep{newLine}
not believing that,{wait:short} but{newLine}
it won't change {shake:1}anything.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
It happened,{wait:short} and if you{newLine}
want to know why I'm{newLine}
not a lawyer anymore...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
...That IS the answer{newLine}
you're after.{textboxEnd}

{sound:punctuate}Maybe you've just decided{newLine}
that closing up is fine.{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That refusing to tell{newLine}
anyone anything like this{newLine}
is fine.{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That I should just{newLine}
